# Dual Button Dimmer Control - Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- Successfully exported 371 entities from Home Assistant
- PRD contains blueprint and script definitions
- Need to implement and test the solution

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Script Setup
- [ ] Create `dimming_loop` script in Home Assistant
- [ ] Create `dimming_loop_down` script in Home Assistant
- [ ] Verify script permissions and configurations

### 2. Blueprint Import
- [ ] Import the blueprint into Home Assistant
- [ ] Configure blueprint with actual button and light entities
- [ ] Test basic functionality (tap up/down)

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test tap functionality (50-400ms press)
  - [ ] UP button tap: Increase brightness by 10%
  - [ ] DOWN button tap: Toggle light on/off
- [ ] Test hold functionality (>400ms press)
  - [ ] UP button hold: Continuous brightening
  - [ ] DOWN button hold: Continuous dimming
- [ ] Test mode: restart behavior

### 4. Debugging
- [ ] Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- [ ] Verify entity states in Developer Tools
- [ ] Test with different light types (dimmable vs non-dimmable)

### 5. Optimization
- [ ] Adjust timing parameters if needed
- [ ] Fine-tune brightness step percentages
- [ ] Optimize transition times

## Known Issues to Address
1. Script dependency: Ensure `dimming_loop` and `dimming_loop_down` exist
2. Button state handling: Verify `state_changed` events are firing correctly
3. Light compatibility: Test with different light types

## Next Steps
1. Deploy scripts to Home Assistant
2. Import and configure blueprint
3. Begin testing with physical buttons
4. Iterate based on test results
