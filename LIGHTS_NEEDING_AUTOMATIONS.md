## 🎯 RECOMMENDED AUTOMATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Banquette Spots (High Priority - Indoor)
**Light**: `light.shellyprodm2pm_2cbcbba40ca0_light_0` (Banquette Spots)
**Suggested Buttons**: Need to determine - possibly unused kitchen panel buttons?
**Action**:
1. First, check if panels are online
2. Determine which button physically controls this light
3. Create automation using blueprint

### Phase 2: Outdoor/Landscape Lights (Use Other Nine Panel)
Map the 8 outdoor lights to "Other Nine Panel" buttons:

| Button | Light | Entity ID |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| NINE1 + DOWN | Driveway | `light.shellypro3_ece334e986dc_switch_0` |
| NINE2 + DOWN | Front Walk | `light.shellypro3_ece334e977e0_switch_2` |
| NINE3 + DOWN | Front Walk Sconce | `light.shellypro3_ece334ed586c_switch_2` |
| NINE4 + DOWN | Garage Sconces | `light.shellypro3_ece334e977e0_switch_1` |
| NINE5 + DOWN | Guest Walkway | `light.shellypro3_ece334ed5278_switch_1` |
| NINE6 + DOWN | Service Walkway | `light.shellypro3_ece334e986dc_switch_2` |
| NINE7 + DOWN | South Landscape | `light.shellypro3_ece334e977e0_switch_0` |
| NINE8 + DOWN | Tree | `light.shellypro3_ece334e986dc_switch_1` |

**8 automations to create**

### Phase 3: Pool Area (Use Terrace Panel)

| Button | Light | Entity ID |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| TERR1 + DOWN | Pool Lights | `light.shellypro3_ece334e97ab8_switch_1` |
| TERR2 + DOWN | Planter By Pool | `light.shellypro3_ece334e97ab8_switch_2` |

**2 automations to create**

## 📝 STEP-BY-STEP CREATION GUIDE

### Method 1: Using HA Blueprint UI (Recommended)

For each light above:

1. **Go to Home Assistant**
   - Navigate to: Settings → Automations & Scenes
   - Click "+ Create Automation"
   - Click "Use a blueprint"

2. **Select Blueprint**
   - Choose "Dimmer Two Button (Click Only)"
   - Or find your `dimmer_two_button.yaml` blueprint

3. **Fill in Parameters**
   - **Automation Name**: `[Light Name] Control` (e.g., "Driveway Control")
   - **Up Button**: Select the UP button entity
   - **Down Button**: Select the corresponding DOWN button entity
   - **Target Light**: Select the light entity
   - **Brightness Step**: 20% (default)
   - **Double Click Window**: 400ms (default)

4. **Save and Test**
   - Save the automation
   - Test single-click (brightness change)
   - Test double-click (on/off or 100%)

### Method 2: YAML File (Bulk Creation)

I can generate a YAML file with all 10 automations pre-configured. You would:
1. Copy the YAML
2. Paste into HA: Configuration → Automations → (kebab menu) → Edit in YAML
3. Save all at once

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Panels Must Be Online First!

**Current Status**: All panel devices showing as UNAVAILABLE

**Before creating automations**:
1. Power cycle all ESP32 panel devices
2. Wait for them to reconnect to WiFi "24"
3. Verify panels show as "Online" in HA
4. Test that button presses register in Developer Tools → Events

**How to test button is working**:
1. Go to Developer Tools → States
2. Find the button entity (e.g., `binary_sensor.other_nine_panel_nine1`)
3. Watch the state while pressing the physical button
4. Should change from "off" to "on" and back to "off"

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Get Panels Online**
   - [ ] Power cycle all 7 panel ESP32 devices
   - [ ] Verify they connect to WiFi
   - [ ] Check status in Home Assistant

2. **Verify Button Mapping**
   - [ ] Test each button physically
   - [ ] Confirm which button is which entity
   - [ ] Update mapping table if needed

3. **Create Automations** (in priority order)
   - [ ] Banquette Spots (1 automation)
   - [ ] Other Nine Panel → Outdoor lights (8 automations)
   - [ ] Terrace Panel → Pool area (2 automations)

4. **Test Each Automation**
   - [ ] Single-click increases/decreases brightness
   - [ ] Double-click turns on to 100% or off
   - [ ] Timing feels responsive (adjust if needed)

**Want me to generate the YAML file for all 10 automations now?**
Or would you prefer to create them one-by-one in the HA UI first?
